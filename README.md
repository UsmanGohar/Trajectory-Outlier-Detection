# Trajectory-Outlier-Detection
My research work on developing scalable techniques for trajectory outlier detection


** After downloading the dataset, run Outlier.py to generate the maps with Outliers (Slow)
** To run a faster version, use kdtree.py. It implements the algorithm using K-D Trees

Please download the dataset (T-Drive) from:(Too big to upload in the repository; change the directory accordingly)
